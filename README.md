Habits, tasks and missions webpage <br />
Basically this project was made by me in order to understand better java as a back-end language and to better my knowledge of it as well as of javascript. I also wanted to learn how to use ajax. <br />
The premise of this project was to make a webpage where users could track their habits, tasks, and missions in order to organise their lives. <br />
Habits would be day to day things to do, just as brushing your teeth or doing the bed. <br />
Tasks are meant to be stuff that you want to do in or in less than a week, as can be shopping or doing cleaning the room. <br />
Missions are things you want to accomplish within a month for example, like reading a book or learning something. <br />
The idea of this project was to be made during winter recess, and the base of the project was accomplish in that time! <br />
